**FORMA** is a digital emulation of a transistor combo organ manufactured in the GDR during the 1980s. It focuses on a specific single-manual model, though voicings from other models may be added in the future.

Implemented features:

* High-quality bandlimited SIMD oscillators.

* Polysynth-style voice allocation with oscillators across voices synced so they won't cancel each other out.

* (Mostly) Accurate *FLUTES II* frequency response voicing from the **Formation 1** model. 5⅓′and 1⅗′ stops are voiced to be a little bit duller. Slightly nonlinear amplifying stage is included.

* Realistic janky keyboard action in which stops are not activated simultaneously. Velocity-sensitive.

* Noise floor and hum (gated).

Planned features (high to low priority):

* Noisy potentiometers.

* *SOLO* stops from the **Formation 1**: *Clarinet, Oboe, and Nasal*. Including the non-linear behaviour of the formant filters.

* Voicings from the **Formation 2** model.

* Voicings from the **ET 6-1** model.

* Percussion section.

* Phaser section.

* Spring Reverb.
