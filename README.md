**VERONIKA** is a digital emulation of a transistor combo organ manufactured in the GDR during the 1980s. It currently focuses on a specific single-manual model, though voicings from other models may be added in the future.

Features:

* *we are here (nothing is made yet)*

Planned features (high to low priority):

* Accurate *FLUTES II* frequency response voicing from the **Formation 1** model.

* Possible *FLUTES II* nonlinearity.

* Non-simultaneous key-on behavior across stops, emulating the original keyboardâ€™s attack characteristics.

* *SOLO* stops from the **Formation 1**: *Clarinet, Oboe, and Nasal*. Including the non-linear behaviour of formant filters.

* Voicings from the **Formation 2** model.

* Voicings from the **ET 6-1** model.

* Percussion section.

* Phaser section.

* Spring Reverb.
